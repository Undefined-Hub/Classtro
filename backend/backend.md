# Backend Detailed Review

## 1. Project Structure & Modularity
- **index.js**: Entry point, sets up Express, connects to MongoDB, registers middleware, and mounts routes.
- **config/Passport.js**: Configures Passport strategies (Local, Google OAuth, JWT). No user serialization/deserialization (JWT-only flow).
- **models/User.js**: Mongoose schema for users, supports both local and Google OAuth, includes refreshToken and profilePicture fields.
- **routes/authRoutes.js**: Route definitions for authentication endpoints, uses controller functions for business logic.
- **controllers/authController.js**: Contains business logic for authentication (login, register, Google OAuth, refresh, logout).
- **routes/utilRoutes.js**: Example protected route (`/status`) to test JWT authentication.
- **routes/index.js**: Aggregates and mounts all route modules with appropriate middleware.
- **middleware/authenticateJWT.js**: Passport JWT middleware for route protection.
- **utils/jwtUtils.js**: Utility functions for generating and verifying JWTs.

## 2. Authentication Flow
### Local Strategy
- User logs in with email/password via `/api/auth/login`.
- Passport local strategy validates credentials and checks `authProvider`.
- Controller (`loginUser`) generates access token (1h) and refresh token (7d).
- Refresh token is stored in DB and sent as HTTP-only cookie.
- Access token is returned in response body.

### Google OAuth Strategy
- User initiates OAuth via `/api/auth/google`.
- Google redirects to `/api/auth/google/callback` after authentication.
- If user exists with different `authProvider`, login is denied with clear message.
- New users are created with Google profile data including profilePicture.
- Controller (`googleAuthCallback`) issues JWT tokens and redirects to frontend with accessToken in URL.

### JWT Strategy
- Protects routes by extracting Bearer token from Authorization header.
- Verifies token signature and attaches user to `req.user`.
- No session state maintained (stateless authentication).

### Refresh Token Flow
- Client sends refresh token via HTTP-only cookie to `/api/auth/refresh`.
- Backend verifies token, checks against stored token in user document.
- Issues new access token if valid, maintains refresh token security.

## 3. Route & File Review
### index.js
- Clean middleware setup: JSON parser, CORS with credentials, cookie-parser, Passport initialization.
- No session middleware (correct for JWT-only architecture).
- Environment-based configuration for database and CORS origin.

### config/Passport.js
- Three strategies: Local (email/password), Google OAuth, JWT.
- Cross-provider authentication prevention (user cannot use Google if registered with Local).
- JWT strategy extracts token from Authorization header and validates against secret.
- No serialization/deserialization (not needed for stateless JWT).

### models/User.js
- Flexible schema supporting multiple auth providers.
- Sparse unique indexes for optional fields (username, email, googleId).
- Role-based access control with enum values.
- Profile picture support for Google OAuth users.
- Refresh token storage for secure token rotation.

### controllers/authController.js
- **loginUser**: Generates tokens, saves refresh token, cleans sensitive data from response.
- **logoutUser**: Clears refresh cookie and removes token from database.
- **registerUser**: Validates input, checks duplicates, hashes passwords.
- **googleAuthCallback**: Handles OAuth success, generates tokens, redirects to frontend.
- **refreshToken**: Validates refresh token, issues new access token.

### routes/authRoutes.js
- Clean separation: routes define endpoints, controllers handle logic.
- Passport middleware integration for authentication strategies.
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling.

### routes/utilRoutes.js
- Protected route example without JWT middleware (should be added).
- Returns authenticated user information.

### routes/index.js
- Modular route mounting with appropriate middleware.
- JWT protection applied to utility routes.

### middleware/authenticateJWT.js
- Simple, reusable JWT authentication middleware.
- Disables sessions for stateless operation.

### utils/jwtUtils.js
- Flexible token generation with configurable secrets and expiry.
- Error handling for token verification.

## 4. Architecture Strengths
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation between routes, controllers, and models.
- **Stateless Authentication**: JWT-based with secure refresh token mechanism.
- **Cross-Provider Security**: Prevents authentication confusion between providers.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new authentication methods.
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure secrets and configurable endpoints.

## 5. Issues & Recommendations
### Current Issues
- `/status` route in `utilRoutes.js` lacks JWT middleware protection.
- Google OAuth callback redirects with token in URL (less secure than POST response).
- No token blacklisting mechanism for compromised tokens.

### Recommendations
- Add JWT middleware to `/status` route for proper protection.
- Consider using popup-based OAuth flow for SPA applications.
- Implement token blacklisting for enhanced security.
- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints.
- Implement password strength validation and account lockout.
- Add comprehensive logging for security events.

## 6. Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds.
- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Secure refresh token storage.
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin access.
- **Token Expiration**: Short-lived access tokens (1h) with refresh mechanism.
- **Provider Validation**: Prevents cross-authentication attacks.

## 7. Overall Assessment
The backend demonstrates excellent architectural principles with proper separation of concerns, secure authentication flows, and modular design. The JWT implementation is robust with refresh token security. Minor improvements needed for route protection and production hardening, but overall structure is production-ready.
