# Releases & Versioning Guide

This document explains how we will handle **versioning, releases, and CI/CD** for the Classtro project.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Versioning Standard

We follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR** â†’ breaking changes (e.g., change architecture)
- **MINOR** â†’ new features (e.g., add analytics dashboard)
- **PATCH** â†’ bug fixes or small improvements (e.g., fix socket reconnect)

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

- `v0.4.0` â†’ Polls + Q&A module
- `v0.4.1` â†’ Bugfix in Q&A
- `v0.5.0` â†’ Quizzes added
- `v1.0.0` â†’ Full demo-ready release

---

## ðŸ”¹ When to Release

- Merge **features** into `development` only.
- After **2â€“3 stable features**, open a PR from `development` â†’ `main`.
- Once merged, tag that commit as a release version.

ðŸ‘‰ Donâ€™t tag every small feature. Use tags for milestones.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Create a Tag & Release

1. Checkout `main` and pull latest:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Create a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.4.0
   git push origin v0.4.0
   ```
3. On GitHub â†’ **Releases** â†’ Draft a new release:
   - Select tag: `v0.4.0`
   - Add title + notes (features, fixes)
   - Publish âœ…

## ðŸ”¹ CI/CD Workflow

- **CI (Continuous Integration):**
  - Runs on all PRs to `development`.
  - Checks lint + tests to ensure code works before merging.

- **CD (Continuous Deployment):**
  - Runs only on merges into `main`.
  - Automatically deploys stable version (frontend to Netlify/Vercel, backend to Render/AWS).

ðŸ‘‰ Flow:

```
feature/* â†’ PR â†’ CI + Code Review â†’ merge â†’ development

[Milestone reached]

development â†’ PR â†’ CI + Code Review â†’ merge â†’ main â†’ Tag + Release â†’ CD (deploy

```

end
```

### Description

1. **Feature Branch (`feature/*`)**: Developers create feature branches for new functionality.
2. **Pull Request (PR) to Development**: Features are merged into `development` after CI checks and code review.
3. **Development Milestone**: Once features accumulate or a milestone is reached, `development` is prepared for main release.
4. **Pull Request (PR) to Main**: The development branch is reviewed, CI runs again, and then merged into `main`.
5. **Tag & Release**: A new release tag is created in `main`.
6. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Code from `main` is deployed to production automatically.

This workflow ensures structured development, review, testing, and deployment.
