## Introduction

Classtro addresses the persistent challenge of low student engagement in classrooms, where many learners hesitate to ask questions due to fear of judgment. Current tools provide partial solutions but lack real-time adaptability, inclusivity, and seamless integration. Classtro enables:

- Anonymous student participation  
- Real-time polling and quizzes  
- Live feedback and analytics for teachers  
- Gamified learning experience

## Features

### Teacher Module
- Create and manage sessions  
- Generate session QR code and join code  
- Launch and monitor live polls and quizzes  
- View real-time analytics and participation trends  

### Student Module
- Join sessions via QR code or code  
- Participate anonymously in polls and quizzes  
- View live results  
- Gamified engagement (XP points, badges, leaderboards)  

### Engagement & Analytics
- Real-time insights on class comprehension  
- Heatmaps and trend analysis  
- Feedback and clarity rating post-session

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React.js, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO |
| Database | MongoDB, Redis (for caching) |

## System Architecture

Classtro connects teacher and student modules via real-time communication using Socket.IO. Data is stored securely in MongoDB, while Redis is used for caching session data to ensure high performance during live interactions. Teachers can launch polls/quizzes in real time, and students can participate anonymously. Analytics dashboards provide instant insights on engagement and learning outcomes.
